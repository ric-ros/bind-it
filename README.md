## THIS WAS PART OF AN EXCERCISE

Bind it!

In this app:

- Create three new components: GameControl, Odd and Even
- The GameControl Component should have buttons to start and stop the game
- When starting the game, an event (holding a incrementing number) should get emitted each second (ref = setInterval())
- The event should be listenable from outside the component
- When stopping the game, no more events should get emitted (clearInterval(ref))
- A new Odd component should get created for every odd number emitted, the same should happen for the Even Component (on even numbers)
- Simply output Odd - NUMBER or Even - NUMBER in the two components
- Style the element (e.g. paragraph) holding your output text differently in both components
